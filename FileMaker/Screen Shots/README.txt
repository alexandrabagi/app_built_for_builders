So here are some screen shots of the development environment in FileMaker. 

It is very hard to show the workflow and development areas because it is a full stack IDE with both UI, backend and frontend in one. 

The script workspace handles scripts, which can call other scripts, both local and remote, as with the "SearchInitials()" script that is run remotely on the server which holds the database with the Users table. 

In script calculations, for instance when setting fields or variables functions are used. And custom functions are developed through another view as shown in the "SelectUsers" folder. 

So stuff is happening different places and therefore it is very difficult to show a complete overview of the environment.

It might seem VERY weird to people who are not familiar with FileMaker ðŸ˜Š
